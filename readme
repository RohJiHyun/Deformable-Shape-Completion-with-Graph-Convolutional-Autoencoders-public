Deformable Shape Completion with Graph Convolutional Autoencoders-public


it is based on Deformable Shape Completion with Graph Convolutional Autoencoders paper's implementation.


__Configurations

numpy
tensorflow-gpu 2.0 or 2.1
libigl for python.

just using requirements.txt

____
/datapreprocessing.
1. first download CoMA dataset files.(it's need login.)
2. extract files. and remove readme in CoMA dataset. 
3. make one more folder(I actually named ./unrpocessed_dataset), and put renamed CoMa folder( rename plain ) on.
4. run fileconverter.py. before using fileconverter, and write your own data root path(for me. ./unprocessed_dataset) _target_input_dir variable in fileconverter.

____
/run model

python main.py [ train | test | summary ]
